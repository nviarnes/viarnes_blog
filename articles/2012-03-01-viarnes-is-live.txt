title: Viarn.es is Live!
date: 01/03/2012


I would officially like to welcome all comers to my newly established blog of randomness! I guess an introduction is in order! My name is Nico Liecty Viarnes. I'm a part time student, and a full time worker. I like to trial bike, do Jiu Jitsu, hack code for fun, and of course watch inordinate amounts of streaming online television!

It has been a long twenty-four hours but I've got Toto up and running on Heroku with some pretty cool features that I customized for myself! For a while I was lucky enough to have a really sweet web development internship with a company called <a href"http://www.soapbxx.com>Soapbxx Llc.</a> and I learned a lot. These days I would consider myself a hobbyist hoping to break into the wild world of tech startups.

I've found that <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead/toto">Toto</a> is an amazingly flexible and light weight blogging engine and it manages to achieve that with out sacrificing customization! So far I'm really enjoying the wiggle room Toto gives me and I plan on seeing how far I can stretch it's limits.

That's it for today folks. My first official blog post ever. I think I'll frame it.



All The Best

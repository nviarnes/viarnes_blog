title: Viarn.es is Live!
date: 01/03/2012


I would officially like to welcome all comers to my newly established blog of randomness! I guess an introduction is in order! My name is Nico Liecty Viarnes. I'm a part time student, and a full time worker. I like to trial bike, do Jiu Jitsu, hack code for fun, and of course watch inordinate amounts of streaming online television!

It has been a long twenty-four hours but I've got Toto up and running on Heroku with some pretty cool features that I customized for myself! For a while I was lucky enough to have a really sweet web development internship with a company called <a href"http://www.soapbxx.com>Soapbxx Llc.</a> and I learned a lot. These days I work long hours at an incredible grocery store. It really is an amazing place, established in 1922 by a Greek immigrant during the depression. His son Nick now owns the business and is something of a neighborhood celebrity; I would wager it's one of the last places in America that still has credit tabs for customers and their children.

I haven't had nearly enough time to hack for fun lately and I feel quite out of practice. Ruby is my native tongue but lately I have acquired a taste for Python so stay tuned for some Pythonian escapades to come! This blog is partially about me reestablishing a bit of a web presence, but mostly about my ongoing journey of self discovery (and more often than not, self destruction....I'm working on it.)

I've found that <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead/toto">Toto</a> is an amazingly flexible and light weight blogging engine that allows for awesome performance, built in version tracking with <a href="https://www.github.com">Git</a>, and awesome potential for customization! So far I'm really enjoying the wiggle room Toto gives me and I plan on seeing how far I can stretch it's limits.

That's it for today folks. My first official blog post ever. I think I'll frame it.



All The Best
